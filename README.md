## Experience

### IOS training at [AROBS](https://arobs.com/)
This was the first time I was working in a software company. This was a five-week internship/training. It started in April 2014 and ended in May 2014.
The first couple of weeks were dedicated to teaching us very basic Objective-C and IOS and for the next few weeks, we tried to improve an application similar to Waze.
